# Indeed-Webscrape
Web scraping project
This is my job web scraping project
It will consist of man updates and commits in the future.
this is the first step --- I web scraped data analyst jobs on indeed.com and saved them as csv file.

Future updates:
  -Adding another variable to read full job description --- in order to --> extract language
  -Natural language processing (NLP) to extract pattern of requirements which are required from job postings --- such as yrs of exp, programming exp etc...
    -This step will require a list of blacklisted and whitelisted words.
  -Expanding project to scrape other websites such as linkedin and glassdoor.
  -making a repository of the data collected over 2 months and using tableau to visualise data for better communication.
